# Data Terminal

It is a minimal, fast, and productive tool to interact with Postgres databases. Data Terminal combines the feel of a command-line interface with the features you'd expect from a modern SQL editor.

## Features

- **Local-first & encrypted**: All connection data is encrypted and stored locally
- **Connections**: Create and manage multiple connections
- **Clutter-free UI**: Minimal design that keeps the focus on your query
- **Shortcuts**: Navigate almost all around using just the keyboard

## Limitations

While heavily inspired by psql, Data Terminal only implements the `\d` (describe) meta-command family (thanks to [psql-describe](https://github.com/neondatabase/psql-describe)).
