# Developer Guide

This document provides instructions for setting up, building, and distributing the application for developers.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed
- Git for version control
- For macOS users: Xcode Command Line Tools

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dataterminalapp/dataterminal.git
   cd dataterminal
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Configuration

#### Package Manager Notes

If you are using a package manager like `nix`, ensure that system libraries are properly linked before compiling:

```sh
# For macOS with nix
export LDFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++ -L/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib"
```

## Build Process

### Development Build

1. Rebuild native modules (necessary after fresh install or when native dependencies change):

   ```sh
   npm run rebuild
   ```

2. Start the application in development mode:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### Troubleshooting Build Issues

- If you encounter compilation errors with native modules:
  - Verify that you have the proper build tools installed
  - Check that system libraries are correctly linked
  - On macOS, ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed: `xcode-select --install`

## Distribution

### Creating Application Packages

To create distributable packages for the current platform:

```sh
npm run package
```

The packaged application will be available at:
`/out/Data Terminal-{os}-{arch}/`

Where:

- `{os}` is your operating system (win32, darwin, linux)
- `{arch}` is your architecture (x64, arm64)

### Cross-Platform Building

To build for a specific platform from another:

```sh
npm run package -- --platform=[platform] --arch=[architecture]
```

Available platforms: darwin
Available architectures: arm64

## Release Management

### Publishing a New Release

To publish a new version and create a release:

1. Update the version in `package.json`
2. Create a new release:
   ```sh
   npm run publish
   ```

This process will:

- Build the application
- Create distributable packages
- Publish the release
- Trigger automatic update notifications for existing users

### Version Control Guidelines

- Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for version numbers
- Create detailed release notes for each version
- Tag releases in the repository with version numbers

## Development Workflow

### Code Style and Linting

Maintain code quality by running:

```sh
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues:

```sh
npm run lint:fix
```

### Running Tests

Execute the test suite:

```sh
npm test
```

**Note:** Running the tests requires Docker to be installed and running on your system. Make sure that Docker is properly set up before running the test.

### UI Testing Guidelines

You will notice that tests primarily involve keyboard interactions. This is the preferred method for testing the UIâ€”using the keyboard rather than searching for components by IDs or content.
